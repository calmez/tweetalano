INSTALLING
----------

At the moment the process of installing is a bit long-winded.

- You have to have Ruby and gems installed.
- Via gem you have to install twitter, oauth, xdg, stfl and yaml.

- Now you have to register a new application on http://www.twitter.com/apps.
  Note:
    Application Type: Client
    Default Access type: Read & Write

- You will get a consumer key and a consumer secret out of that.
  Save those in a file called <HOME-CONFIG-DIR>/tweetalano/config.yaml like that:

    consumer:
        key: "<YOUR-KEY>"
        secret: "<YOUR-SECRET>"

- Now you can start tweetalano for the first time!!1! (Whhoooo)
  It will offer you an url that you have to go to in order to authenticate the
  application against twitter. The website will give you a key that you have to
  enter to tweetalano.You will get an oauth token and an oauth secret back from
  tweetalano.

- Add oauth token an secret again to <HOME-CONFIG-DIR>/tweetalano/config.yaml
  so that it looks like this:
    
    consumer:
        key: "<YOUR-CUSTOMER-KEY>"
        secret: "<YOUR-CUSTOMER-SECRET>"
    oauth:
        token: "<YOUR-OAUTH-TOKEN>"
        secret: "<YOUR-OAUTH-SECRET>"

  Note that it is very helpful to pipe stderr to a file in order to save the
  oauth token and secret, because tweetalano will start finally after entering
  the code from the website.

- Have much fun using tweetalano!!1!
